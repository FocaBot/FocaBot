# By default FocaBot automatically downloads recent ffmpeg builds and uses those instead
# of the system binaries, if you're having issues with audio playback, uncomment those lines
# to use the system binaries (or custom ones) instead.

##
# FocaBot 1.x has an internal Gun database server listening at port 12920 by default.
#
# This should be fine most of the time, but if you have something else listening on
# that port, you can define another one below.
#
# Also, if you're running multiple instances of FocaBot on the same machine, be sure
# to define a different port to each one, otherwise they will share the same database,
# which causes undesirable behavior most of the time.

DB_PORT=12920
DB_FILE=data.db

##
# Uncomment these to use Redis instead of Gun
# 
# This is recommended for large bots, as Gun has some issues handling large datasets
##
# USE_REDIS=true
# REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1/1
