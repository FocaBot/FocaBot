FocaBot is an easy to use music bot for discord, it includes most of the commands
you would expect for a music but, plus some extras, like a `seek` command, many
audio filters (`| nightcore`, anyone?), and advanced queue management (`move`, `swap`, `remove`)

It includes some non-music related modules as well, like a tag system, configurable server greetings,
Google Images, Danbooru and Imgur search, among other stuff.

It's built on top of the [Azarasi](https://github.com/FocaBot/Azarasi) framework
and [Discord.js](https://qeled.github.io/discordie/). It's easy to create your own modules.

## Quick Setup

If you want to host the bot yourself, you'll only need these commands (Node.js must be installed):

```
$ npm install -g focabot
$ focabot
```

For advanced needs, including sharded setups and custom modules, check the documentation.
